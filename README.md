This module acts as a [man in the middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) on Pok√©mon Go's communications with the server, and allows us to add extra *features* to the game.

- It does not require your account or any information about you.
- It does not communicate with the server at any time, so it's pretty safe against detection.
- It does not require any right (no data usage, ...)

### Features:
- Prevent PokemonGo from detecting GPS is being spoofed (similar to Mock Mock Locations)
- Replace pokemons name with custom formats ([details](https://github.com/alucas/Snorlax/wiki/Rename-formats)) :
  - Name, Nickname
  - Level
  - Type
  - Moves (name, type, power)
  - IV (%, attack, defence, stamina)
  - HP (current, max)
  - CP (current, evolution, last evolution, min, max)
